# My Name?

My apologies... 

I cannot disclose any personal information (internet these days *sigh*) due to the fact (as you so correctly pointed out) that our friendship status seems to have expired due to neglect (I blame you)...

But no fear... I am internet savvy... and I say: theres an [app](http://quinns-friend-application.herokuapp.com/) for that!
